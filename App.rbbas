With curl it works fine.		  2/ Using the shell in a synchronous manner slows things down, which in this case is better -- you need to throttle downloads.		     Of course I could throttle with asynchronous downloads too, but the shell made it easy.				There are two passes.				Pass 1:		 • Get the first page -- pagination trick ?page_id=x (Thanks Nick!) and identify the total number of pages.		 • Then extract the question/answer links for pass 2. They are spread over 5 workers.				Pass2:		 • Create a folder fwor the answers, and a subfolder for the images		 • Once we have all the links, start the workers. They go through the list of links they've been given.		 • When a link is received, the page is saved. The date the question was answered/the answer updated is extracted.		 • The image links are extracted and the images saved in the subfolder. JPEG and PNG images are recognized and properly named.				A log file, log.txt, is produced with most of what's happening during the execution.			#tag EndNote	#tag Constant, Name = kEditClear, Type = String, Dynamic = False, Default = \"&Delete", Scope = Public		#Tag Instance, Platform = Windows, Language = Default, Definition  = \"&Delete"		#Tag Instance, Platform = Linux, Language = Default, Definition  = \"&Delete"	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = kFileQuit, Type = String, Dynamic = False, Default = \"&Quit", Scope = Public		#Tag Instance, Platform = Windows, Language = Default, Definition  = \"E&xit"	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = kFileQuitShortcut, Type = String, Dynamic = False, Default = \"", Scope = Public		#Tag Instance, Platform = Mac OS, Language = Default, Definition  = \"Cmd+Q"		#Tag Instance, Platform = Linux, Language = Default, Definition  = \"Ctrl+Q"	#tag EndConstant	#tag ViewBehavior	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Class#tag EndClass
